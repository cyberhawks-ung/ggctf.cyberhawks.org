## ❓ FAQ

***Why is there a registration fee?***

Running an in-person competition like this costs a lot of money, upwards of $3,000!. Costs for food, shirts, prizes, and infrastructure all adds up.

***What type of food will be served for lunch?***

We are currently evaluating catering options. We will try our best to accommodate dietary restrictions.

***Can I use AI and LLMs?***

You are allowed to use free or self-hosted models. No paid models, please.

***Is there any special software I need?***

We recommend installing [VMWare Workstation/Fusion Pro](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html) and using the pre-built [Kali virtual machine](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) for VMware.
